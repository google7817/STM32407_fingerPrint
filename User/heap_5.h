/*
 * A sample implementation of pvPortMalloc() that allows the heap to be defined
 * across multiple non-contigous blocks and combines (coalescences) adjacent
 * memory blocks as they are freed.
 *
 * See heap_1.c, heap_2.c, heap_3.c and heap_4.c for alternative
 * implementations, and the memory management pages of http://www.FreeRTOS.org
 * for more information.
 *
 * Usage notes:
 *
 * vPortDefineHeapRegions() ***must*** be called before pvPortMalloc().
 * pvPortMalloc() will be called if any task objects (tasks, queues, event
 * groups, etc.) are created, therefore vPortDefineHeapRegions() ***must*** be
 * called before any other objects are defined.
 *
 * vPortDefineHeapRegions() takes a single parameter.  The parameter is an array
 * of HeapRegion_t structures.  HeapRegion_t is defined in portable.h as
 *
 * typedef struct HeapRegion
 * {
 *	uint8_t *pucStartAddress; << Start address of a block of memory that will be part of the heap.
 *	size_t xSizeInBytes;	  << Size of the block of memory.
 * } HeapRegion_t;
 *
 * The array is terminated using a NULL zero sized region definition, and the
 * memory regions defined in the array ***must*** appear in address order from
 * low address to high address.  So the following is a valid example of how
 * to use the function.
 *
 * HeapRegion_t xHeapRegions[] =
 * {
 * 	{ ( uint8_t * ) 0x80000000UL, 0x10000 }, << Defines a block of 0x10000 bytes starting at address 0x80000000
 * 	{ ( uint8_t * ) 0x90000000UL, 0xa0000 }, << Defines a block of 0xa0000 bytes starting at address of 0x90000000
 * 	{ NULL, 0 }                << Terminates the array.
 * };
 *
 * vPortDefineHeapRegions( xHeapRegions ); << Pass the array into vPortDefineHeapRegions().
 *
 * Note 0x80000000 is the lower address so appears in the array first.
